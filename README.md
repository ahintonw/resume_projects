A collection of projects on my resume

Project 1: Horse Racing Outcome Prediction Model (Early Version):
This version contains the first successful convergence I achieved using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for predicting horse race outcomes. It predates the integration of the explosion technique from academic literature, which later improved model accuracy to ~42%. Current iterations (not included here) are incorporating jockey data in an effort to surpass the 50% accuracy threshold.

Project 2: Qunatitative beta-constrained long-short portfolio optimization:
Built a beta-constrained long-short equity portfolio over a 2-day sprint for a firmâ€™s evaluation project. Designed a market-neutral strategy using historical data from Jan 2022 to mid-2025, optimizing for risk-adjusted returns while maintaining low beta exposure. Delivered code, a one-page report, and a recorded walkthrough of the methodology and results.

Project 3: Quantitative Equities Screener Tool - TBA
