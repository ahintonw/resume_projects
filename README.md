Project 1: Horse Racing Outcome Prediction Model (Early Version):
This version contains the first successful convergence I achieved using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for predicting horse race outcomes. It predates the integration of the explosion technique from academic literature, which later improved model accuracy to ~42%. Current iterations (not included here) are incorporating jockey data in an effort to surpass the 50% accuracy threshold.
